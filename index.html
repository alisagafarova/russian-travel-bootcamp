          <h2 class = "intro__title">What haven't we seen there?</h2>
          <p class = "intro__text">According to VCIOM surveys, 95% of Russians dream of traveling somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend their vacation in their home country.
            They think: what haven’t we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is an entire universe with the warm sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayans, and the harsh ice of the Putorana Plateau.
            And you can see all these beauties without millions in your account, a foreign passport, or long-haul flights.
            Just like Vera Bashmakova — a brave young mother who took her three kids, put them in her Lada, and drove 20,000 kilometers across her homeland.
            We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Here, among forests and sand dunes, you can see two water horizons—the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural area on the edge of the Russian enclave.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">But the Kaliningrad region doesn’t end here. Nearby, travelers and explorers can find Russia’s westernmost point, the Baltic Spit, as well as the German heritage scattered across small coastal towns. The atmosphere of this place eliminates any rush, immersing you in the tranquility of nature and the scent of the steel-colored, cool sea.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Almost the entire peninsula lies beyond the Arctic Circle. The Sami tundra stretches south into the taiga, while to the north, the Arctic Ocean disguises itself as the Barents Sea.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">Perhaps you've seen Zvyagintsev's films or heard of the Arctic festival in Teriberka. Perhaps the word "Khibiny" hasn’t been buried under childhood geography lessons. Perhaps you’ve never been curious about the ultra-deep borehole that penetrates the Earth's crust, and apatite has long left you feeling apathetic. But your dream of witnessing the northern lights begins with a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

          <div class="place__paragraphs">
              <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.  
                Primarily because of its mountains: if you travel along the ridge, you'll see slopes covered in pines, mountain rivers, and lakes.  
                And if you open your car windows, you’ll experience the invisible wonder of this place—the fresh mountain air.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so the best time to visit is summer.  
                That way, you can witness the full diversity of local flora and fauna.  
                Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles soar over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains.  
                And the famous Pallas’s cats also call the Altai region home.</p>

              <p class="place__paragraph">Lake Baikal is well known as the largest lake in the world.  
                Many also know it as the biggest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
              <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, all of this is true. But Baikal is also a perfect place for skijoring competitions.  
                This sport involves a skier being pulled by a motorcycle, with the duo trying to reach maximum speed on ice.  
                In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the "Baikal Mile" festival.</p>

          <div class="place__paragraphs">
              <p class="place__paragraph">Siberia doesn't end at the Urals but rather in Karelia: the Siberian larch, which forms the taiga, doesn't grow west of Vodlozero.  
                But here, it reaches 30 meters in height—thanks to the impassable swamps, the forests of Karelia's national parks have never known an axe.  
                Some pine trees here are over 500 years old. Touch a living being that saw the sun long before Ivan the Terrible did.  
                In the primeval forest, you won't find a trail for hundreds of kilometers.  
                And on the rare paths, trees just a couple of meters above the ground bear the claw marks of bears—so everyone knows who's in charge here.</p>
